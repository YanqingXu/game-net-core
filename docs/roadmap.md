# Roadmap

game-net-core is the component-split migration target for `mini_trantor`.
The roadmap keeps that migration staged so the networking core becomes stable
before protocol, transport, game-foundation, or experimental modules are added.
See `migration_status.md` for the current checked state of these phases.

## Phase 1: Project Skeleton

- Initialize CMake, README, repository rules, and documentation structure.
- Establish public header and implementation layout.

## Phase 2: Reactor / TCP Core

- Migrate Logger, Timestamp, noncopyable, socket primitives, Channel, Poller,
  Wakeup, TimerQueue, EventLoop, and TCP lifecycle components.
- Keep the first target focused on `gamenet_core`.

## Phase 3: Targets and Tests

- Split unit, contract, and integration tests.
- Add minimal echo-server coverage for the TCP path.
- Export and install `GameNet::core` so downstream components can consume the
  split package through `find_package(GameNetCore)`.

## Phase 3.5: Core Preview Hardening

Completed in the current worktree:

- make `TcpConnection::connected()` / `disconnected()` atomic snapshot observers;
- make TcpConnection callback, context, and socket-option mutation owner-loop-only;
- marshal TcpServer callback installation/replacement to each connection owner loop;
- fix the Linux repeated-connect failure found in `ci` run `29059799283` by
  releasing Connector member ownership before deferred Channel destruction;
- fix the second Linux repeated-connect ordering failure found in `ci` run
  `29073362905` by admitting one generation-tagged `connect()` request per
  pending/active lifecycle and releasing it after terminal failure/teardown;
- define Logger runtime replacement, callback snapshot/concurrency, re-entry,
  and capture-lifetime semantics with a threading contract;
- add a default-off, non-CTest core benchmark with versioned JSON output for
  echo throughput/latency, connection working-set growth, worker-loop scaling,
  and slow-client accumulation;
- record the first local Windows MSVC Release baseline, including the current
  single-completion IOCP mode and raw JSON evidence;
- classify all 52 formal intents with machine-checked active/deferred/legacy
  metadata so historical mini_trantor stages and test counts cannot authorize
  current work;
- replace self-referential HEAD documentation with immutable validation records;
- pass local Windows Debug, Release, install-consumer, and 5-repeat threading preflight;
- validate candidate `a7fd77cbd2140041cebb3f900d5c609fafc2adad` in `ci`
  run `29076601085` with all five Linux/Windows jobs green;
- pass remote `long-soak` run `29077148022` with all 46 threading tests at
  repeat 50 and a 60-second per-test timeout;
- retain same-SHA Linux epoll and Windows IOCP Release JSON artifacts from
  `core-benchmark` run `29077151229`;
- merge PR #2 without rewriting the validated candidate, pass all five jobs in
  main `ci` run `29079836593`, and publish annotated tag
  `v0.1.0-core-preview` at release commit
  `c4818d4b3956c85830e04d4a1f32df4ad701d453`.

Phase 3.5 has no remaining gates. The release evidence chain is:

1. code candidate `a7fd77cbd2140041cebb3f900d5c609fafc2adad`;
2. PR five-job CI run `29076601085`, long-soak run `29077148022`, and
   benchmark run `29077151229`;
3. release merge commit `c4818d4b3956c85830e04d4a1f32df4ad701d453`,
   main five-job CI run `29079836593`, and tag `v0.1.0-core-preview`.

## Phase 4: Higher-level Modules

The Phase 4 foundation is implemented locally with each module behind its own
intent, invariant, contract, and test gate:

- [x] Add length-delimited PacketFramer and fuzz smoke coverage.
- [x] Add TransportEndpoint and a TCP adapter without changing core lifecycle.
- [x] Add network-only PlayerSession/SessionManager lifecycle state.
- [x] Add a bounded GameCommandQueue and fixed-tick LogicLoop.
- [x] Add a non-installed pipeline demo with real TCP integration coverage.
- [x] Add broadcast owner-loop grouping, task budgets, and backpressure reasons.
- [ ] Keep UDP/KCP work experimental and independently gated.

The current Phase 4 evidence is local Windows Debug/Release and install-consumer
validation. Remote Linux/sanitizer CI evidence must be recorded separately and
must not be inferred from the Phase 3.5 Core Preview runs.
